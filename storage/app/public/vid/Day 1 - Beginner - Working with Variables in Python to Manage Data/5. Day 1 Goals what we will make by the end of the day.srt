Hey guys, welcome to day 1 of your 100-day journey.
1

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,290
And today we're going to learn about printing, commenting, debugging,
2

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,240
string manipulation and variables.
3

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,720
So it's chockablock full of really fun stuff.
4

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,170
And by the end of today you will have created a band name generator program.
5

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,760
So you can also head over to this web address, band-name
6

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,680
-generator-end.appbrewery.repl.run
7

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,510
Alternatively, if you didn't want to type that whole line of URL in,
8

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,290
you could also go to the previous lesson where I showed you where the course
9

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,270
resources are and we've got links to all of these resources where you can just
10

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,340
click on it and head over there straight away.
11

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,970
So this is the final project of today and the idea is that let's say that your
12

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,270
friend was starting a new band, a rock band, or a classical band,
13

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,900
and they're struggling to come up with a good name.
14

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,460
So you come into the rescue and send them your band name generator program.
15

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,550
So it asks you for the name of the city that you grew up in.
16

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,870
So mine was Bristol in the Southwest of the UK.
17

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,380
And then it'll ask you what's the name of your pets?
18

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,510
I had a pet rabbit when I was younger and I am probably, um,
19

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,370
the least imaginative person. Um, classic programmer personality. Um,
20

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,620
so I called my rabbit, um, rabbit.
21

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,410
So now when I hit enter,
22

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,090
it's going to give me my band name and it could be, um,
23

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,860
Bristol Rabbit. So that sounds pretty cool. It could be like a, a rock band.
24

25
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,950
So this is what you're going to make and in the process,
25

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,550
in order to create this, you're going to learn about printing, inputting,
26

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,850
commenting, debugging, name, error, syntax errors,
27

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,390
string manipulation, variables, and a whole lot more.
28

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,460
So if you feel like you can already achieve this and you can prove it by making
29

30
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,780
this program yourself, then feel free to skip to the next day's lessons.
30

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,680
But for most of you, even if you've started learning Python programming,
31

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,700
there's probably still a lot of new things that you'll find in today's lessons.
32

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,680
So once you're ready,
33

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,210
head over to the next lesson and let's get started and get coding straight away.
