00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,410
To begin, open up your browser and head over to this you URL: repl.it/@appbrewery/day-1-printing-start
1

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,390
repl.it/@appbrewery/day-1-printing-start
2

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,770
Now if you didn't want to type all of that out and make some typos and errors and not get to the right
3

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,750
place, then simply just head over to the course resources and click on the link there. It'll take you
4

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,070
directly to this page.
5

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,780
Now, once you've clicked on the link that takes you to the starting repl.it, you should see something
6

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,950
that looks like this.
7

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,440
And the first thing I want you to do is to go ahead and click on the fork button.
8

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,540
What this is going to do is it's going to create a version of that same repl.it that you'll see me
9

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,890
working through in the videos.
10

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,710
But in this case, you'll be able to edit it.
11

12
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,690
So if you want to save the work that you're doing, I recommend signing up to repl.it.
12

13
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,770
It's completely free.
13

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,690
You don't need any credit cards or anything.
14

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,290
And then you'll have to see a record of all of the code that you've written throughout the course.
15

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,020
In this course, you'll be coding along with me on repl.it and completing a whole bunch of interactive coding
16

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,310
exercises in our repl.it classroom.
17

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,870
Now, on day 15, when we level up to the intermediate stage, I'm going to be showing you how to install
18

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,420
a local Python code editor.
19

20
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,850
But until then, we want to get up and running and coding straight away.
20

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,970
So we're going to be using repl.it for the first 14 days.
21

22
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,970
So this video now and create your free repl.it account.
22

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,700
And once you're signed in, then you can actually go ahead and edit the name of the repl.it or add a
23

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,070
brief description and you'll be able to access it later on through the "My Repls" folder.
24

25
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,970
Now, once you've done that, then let's go ahead and walk through some of the different parts of repl.it
25

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,970
that you'll be using. First on the left hand side pane here
26

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,940
you've got some files. And you can see the current file that's open is this python file here.
27

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,220
And you can create new files or you can create new folders and later on will be using these features
28

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,810
to organize our code.
29

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:14,450
Now, the other part of the left hand side pane that's really useful is the settings tab here.
30

31
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,610
And I generally prefer to code using a darker background.
31

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,640
It's slightly easier on my eyes, especially when you're working at night and I recommend everybody
32

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,180
to switch their font size up to large.
33

34
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,970
This just makes it so much easier to identify mistakes and any typos you make.
34

35
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:38,450
Now we're going to leave everything else as it is and you can click on the settings button to collapse
35

36
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,190
that pane so that you end up with more space for writing code.
36

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,370
And this area here is where you're going to be doing that.
37

38
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,730
All of your code is going to go inside here.
38

39
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,730
And once we're done with writing our code we'll click run and it will execute and the results of our
39

40
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,060
code will come up over on the console in the right here.
40

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,640
So these are some of the most important parts of repl.it, but the important thing is it allows us to just
41

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,650
get started.
42

43
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,540
Now, remember that the whole reason why we're learning to program is to be able to tell the computer
43

44
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,390
what it needs to do and for it to follow our commands.
44

45
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,680
So let's go ahead and tell the computer to do something, and we can do that by writing our first line
45

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,290
of code.
46

47
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,400
So in this case, I'm creating something called a print function, which is just the word print - all
47

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,930
in lowercase - and then followed by a set of parentheses.
48

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,410
Now, inside these parentheses, I'm going to tell it what I want it to print and hopefully it's going
49

50
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,010
to output that inside our console.
50

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,250
So I'm going to start off by writing the classic "Hello World" inside here.
51

52
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,190
And then once you're ready, then go ahead and click "run".
52

53
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,940
After a few seconds, you should see the computer follow your command, namely printing the words that
53

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,740
you told it to print inside the console or the output area over here.
54

55
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,730
And once it's done, it indicates that with the little orange arrow and the way that this command works
55

56
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,600
is super simple, you have the keyword "print" followed by a set of parentheses, and then inside the
56

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,410
parentheses, you tell it what you want it to print.
57

58
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,320
And once you've inserted that, then when this line of code gets executed by the computer, you'll know
58

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,360
to simply print or output the thing that you've placed in between the parentheses.
59

60
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:44,220
But notice here that it's not just the word "Hello world!" exclamation mark that I've put inside my parentheses,
60

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,930
I've also added some quotation marks or double quotes around the word.
61

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,910
And the reason why I've done this is so that I can tell the computer that this bit here in between the
62

63
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,060
double quotes is not code.
63

64
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,120
It's not like print where it's supposed to do something.
64

65
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,300
This is just some text that I've made up that I want it to print out.
65

66
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,100
And these pieces of text in programming lingo is known as strings. And you can imagine it as almost
66

67
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,610
like a pearl necklace, right?
67

68
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,300
It's a string of characters.
68

69
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:30,050
And what the double quotes do is they basically show the beginning and the end of that string of characters.
69

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,420
So that means you have to be really careful when you're typing, for example, if I go ahead and I miss
70

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,950
out the closing quote.
71

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,330
Well, now you can see that there's some changes that have happened to our code already. Namely that
72

73
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,660
the last parentheses, instead of being colored and white, like the opening parentheses or how it used
73

74
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,660
to be, it's now colored in orange.
74

75
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,790
And this is a subtle hint to us.
75

76
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,720
You're going to get really attuned to these subtle hints because they are the clues that will tell you
76

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
what might have gone wrong in your code.
77

78
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,540
If I run this code as it is right now, it's going to break.
78

79
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,630
It's going to give me a syntax error.
79

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,000
And it says something that seems like it's completely non English.
80

81
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,160
So how can we figure out what this means?
81

82
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,680
Now, the thing I want you to know is that all programmers make mistakes.
82

83
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:34,810
We all make lots of errors, like forgetting to add the double quotes at the end of the string or forgetting
83

84
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,930
to add a closing parentheses.
84

85
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,250
These things are just common errors because we're human.
85

86
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:48,310
But the thing that differentiates great programmers is we're really good at figuring out what the problem
86

87
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,510
is and how to fix it.
87

88
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,190
So you can imagine that coding is just a whole bunch of problems that you have to solve.
88

89
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:01,450
And in this case, when we get some sort of red text on the right and our code is not doing what we
89

90
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:08,050
expected to do, then all we have to do is take this entire error message where it says something,
90

91
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,830
something error.
91

92
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,350
And this is some sort of message that we're supposed to understand and we're simply going to drop it
92

93
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,010
into Google.
93

94
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:20,500
And usually, the first thing you come across will be from a website called stackoverflow.com.
94

95
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,710
And this is basically the Q&amp;A website that all developers will go to whenever something is wrong with
95

96
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,350
their code or when they can't figure out how to do something.
96

97
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,500
So if we click on this link, you can see that somebody else has also had this error and some kind souls
97

98
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,680
have told us that the solution might be the fact that you're missing a double quote before the end of
98

99
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,180
the line.
99

100
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:51,310
So if we take a look back at our code, the code that generated this error looks like this.
100

101
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,290
And indeed, we are missing a double quote at the end of our string.
101

102
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,340
As you're learning to code, as you're going through your 100 days, I want you to become more and more
102

103
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:10,270
attuned to the color 🎨 of your code, because one of the most helpful things that code editors such as
103

104
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,740
this do for us is something called syntax highlighting.
104

105
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:21,880
For example, when I was missing that double quote, it highlighted this entire thing in this orange
105

106
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,290
color.
106

107
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,180
And that is basically it telling us: "It seems like this whole thing is some text"
107

108
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,630
It thinks that all of this is a string and that we're missing a closing parenthesis.
108

109
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,400
So if you notice this and you're like "Wait, actually that's not right. This part should be orange"
109

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,380
because this is what I want to be printed.
110

111
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,240
But this part should match the color of the open brace, which is white.
111

112
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,200
So there must be something wrong here.
112

113
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:58,240
And indeed, if you have a look at the error message, it actually has a little caret sign right here
113

114
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:05,410
showing you that there's something that's probably not right here and it might jog your memory that
114

115
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,740
"Oh, yeah, I've forgotten a closing, double quote." 🤦‍♂️
115

116
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,090
And now when we run our code, you'll see that it's good as new.
116

117
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,760
So now it's your turn to try it out in a code challenge.
117

118
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,670
Head over to the next lesson, sign up to our classroom and then I'll guide you through getting started
118

119
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,200
on your first coding challenge.
119

120
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,050
So all of that and more.
120

121
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,470
I'll see you in the next lesson.
