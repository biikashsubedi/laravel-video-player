33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,980
So if you are somebody who's never coded before,
33

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,930
I'll be with you every step of the way as I take you from programming
34

35
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,400
fundamentals through to more intermediate and advanced programming concepts.
35

36
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,820
You're going to learn Python from scratch. Now,
36

37
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,330
if you are an advanced developer 👨‍💻 on the other hand then take a look at the
37

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,100
curriculum and start at the level that suits you best. From beginner to
38

professional, every level is covered in the course. Got school?

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,980
Working a full-time job? Have to look after kids? I know you're busy.
40

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,260
I've ⏳ timed each day of the course,
41

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,690
to take less than 2 hours to complete.
42

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,330
So you can fit the course around your life.
43

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,580
This course has exactly the same curriculum as our in-person programming
44

45
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,930
bootcamp. So instead of spending thousands of dollars and taking time off work,
45

46
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,400
you will get access to
46

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
exactly the same curriculum with years of design and testing behind it to insure
47

48
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,710
that you don't just know what to do, but also why you're doing it. Now,

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,300
don't just take my word for it.
